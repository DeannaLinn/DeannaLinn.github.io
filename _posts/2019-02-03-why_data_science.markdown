My name is Deanna and I have decided to pursue a career in Data Science. 

I have a bachelor of science in physics and I have mostly worked in STEM* outreach since graduating. While I enjoyed sharing my enthusiam for math and science with the general public, k-12 students, and families, I would like to redirect my career toward a more technical path. I joined Flatiron School to help me get a jumpstart toward this goal. 

As a physics major I really enjoyed solving physics related problems and I definitely see myself using those problems solving skills within data science. I like looking for different ways to solve a problem and I also like math. I see myself using skills in math, statistics, programming, and other related subjects to organize large data sets. I am also drawn to the creative aspect such as applying the technical skills to uncover solutions hidden in the data to take on business challenges and goals.

While I learned that I enjoy the challenges that come along with solving tough problems as a physics major, I also realized that I enjoy sharing what I learn through talks, poster presentations, oureach, and workshops. I see data science as a compatible choice with my career goals where problem solving and communication skills intersect. 

I look forward to completing the data science course created by the Flatiron School and starting my career as a data scientist.
